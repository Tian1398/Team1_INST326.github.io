# Team1_INST326.github.io
A data analysis project on stocks of Apple &amp; Microsoft

This is a short introduction to the package on data analysis of two technology companies’ stock prices. 

Here, you can find two .csv files that provide the data for the stock prices of Apple and Microsoft, respectively. 
### EOD-AAPL.csv
### EOD-MSFT.csv
The original data source is Quandl. They cover the data from 2013 to 2017. The goal of this program is to examine if there is a difference of stock price between Apple and Microsoft during the period of time.

The data analysis code is included in a .py file: 
###FinalProject_Team1_INST326.py

This program will produce four different graphs comparing Apple’s and Microsoft’s adjusted closing price. The five graphs will include a boxplot, a bar chart, a scatter plot, line graph and a regression plot. The program will also output the results from a regression test and a t-test. This program provides the user with the technical data involved in analyzing a stock and will rely on the user’s knowledge to interpret the results.
